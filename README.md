### Greetings ðŸ––

I am an enterprising software developer looking to advance our society through the effective application of technology and software. I strive to extend accessibility to computer science learning opportunities and work towards multidisciplinary solutions for societal issues.

I am currently studying **Computer Science in the Grainger College of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign**, looking to explore the world of technology and software, *one step at a time*.

I do my best to help those around me, through [teaching](https://compscikids.net), [creating useful applications](https://anandani4136.github.io/Stock-Market-Analysis/), or simply offering aid whenever I can. 

Feel free to look around, learn from my successes and setbacks, and hopefully be inspired for your next creation. **Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions, comments, or anything you would like to share!**
